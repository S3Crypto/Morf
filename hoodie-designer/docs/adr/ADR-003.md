# ADR 0003: AR Integration Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The 3D Hoodie Designer application requires AR functionality to visualize hoodie models on users through the MacBook camera. We need to determine the most effective approach for implementing this AR integration given browser capabilities and our technical constraints.

## Decision

We will use the **WebXR Device API** as our primary AR integration approach, with **AR.js** as a fallback for browsers with limited WebXR support.

## Rationale

- **WebXR Device API** is the standard web API for AR/VR experiences
- Native integration with modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Direct access to camera and motion sensors
- Low-level control for custom body tracking implementation
- **AR.js** provides fallback support for browsers with limited WebXR capabilities
- Both approaches work well with Three.js, our chosen 3D rendering library

## Alternatives Considered

1. **8th Wall**: Commercial solution with excellent tracking, but requires subscription and is closed-source.
2. **Custom WebRTC + TensorFlow.js**: Could provide more flexible body tracking but would significantly increase development complexity.
3. **Native AR with WebView bridge**: Would require platform-specific code and lose the advantages of a web-only solution.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Standards-based approach with future-proof implementation
- Direct integration with Three.js
- No dependency on external services for core functionality
- Works across multiple browser vendors (with varying levels of support)

### Negative

- WebXR is still evolving, with inconsistent browser support
- MacBook cameras may have limitations for accurate body tracking
- Performance may vary significantly across devices
- Development and testing complexity due to hardware requirements

## Implementation Notes

We will implement a tiered approach:
1. Check for WebXR support and use it if available
2. Fall back to AR.js if WebXR is not supported
3. Provide graceful degradation to non-AR 3D viewing if neither is available

For body tracking, we will:
1. Use WebXR's hit testing for basic positioning
2. Implement TensorFlow.js body pose detection for more accurate tracking
3. Map detected body points to 3D model attachment points
