# ADR 0005: State Management Approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The 3D Hoodie Designer application requires a state management solution to handle:
- 3D model properties and transformations
- UI control states
- AR session status
- Upload/download processes

We need a solution that balances simplicity, performance, and developer experience.

## Decision

We will use **React Context API with useReducer** for state management, with selective use of local component state where appropriate.

## Rationale

- **React Context API** provides a built-in solution without additional dependencies
- **useReducer** offers predictable state transitions similar to Redux but with less boilerplate
- This approach integrates well with TypeScript for type-safe state management
- Sufficient for the scale and complexity of our application
- Easier learning curve compared to external state management libraries
- Good performance for our use case with appropriate context splitting

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Redux**: More structured but introduces additional complexity and boilerplate code.
2. **MobX**: More magical and less explicit than our chosen approach.
3. **Zustand**: Lightweight alternative but introduces an additional dependency.
4. **Recoil**: Experimental at the time of decision, with potential future changes.
5. **Component-only state**: Would lead to prop drilling and state synchronization issues.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simplified state management with built-in React features
- Reduced bundle size without external dependencies
- Explicit state transitions with reducers
- Easy integration with React's component lifecycle
- Good TypeScript support for type-safe state

### Negative

- Less standardized patterns compared to Redux
- Need careful context splitting to avoid unnecessary re-renders
- May require more manual optimization compared to specialized libraries
- Limited dev tools compared to Redux

## Implementation Notes

We will implement the following contexts:

1. **ModelContext**: For 3D model state and transformations
   - Current model information
   - Model transformations (position, rotation, scale)
   - Model loading status

2. **UIContext**: For UI-related state
   - Active tool selection
   - Panel visibility states
   - Modal states

3. **ARContext**: For AR session state
   - AR session status
   - Camera permissions
   - Body tracking data

Each context will be implemented with:
- A clearly defined state interface
- A reducer for state transitions
- A context provider component
- Custom hooks for consuming the context

## Performance Considerations

- Split contexts by update frequency to minimize re-renders
- Use memoization for expensive derivations from state
- Implement selective updates for Three.js objects
