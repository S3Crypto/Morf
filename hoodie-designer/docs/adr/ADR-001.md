# ADR 0001: Frontend Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a frontend framework for the 3D Hoodie Designer application. The framework should support modern web development practices, have good integration with Three.js and WebXR, and enable efficient development and testing.

## Decision

We will use **React** with **TypeScript** and **Vite** as our frontend technology stack.

## Rationale

- **React** is a widely adopted library with excellent community support and a rich ecosystem of complementary libraries.
- **TypeScript** provides type safety, improving developer experience and reducing runtime errors.
- **Vite** offers fast development server and optimized builds, which is crucial for a graphics-intensive application.
- React's component-based architecture aligns well with our modular design goals.
- There are several well-maintained libraries for integrating Three.js with React (react-three-fiber, drei).
- TypeScript's type system helps manage the complexity of 3D transformations and AR integration.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Vue.js**: While Vue.js has good Three.js integration, React has more mature libraries for 3D rendering and AR.
2. **Angular**: More opinionated and heavier than needed for this project, with less flexible integration with Three.js.
3. **Plain JavaScript with Three.js**: Would require more boilerplate for state management and component organization.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fast development with hot module replacement
- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Rich ecosystem of supporting libraries
- Good developer tooling
- Efficient component updates with React's virtual DOM

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers not familiar with React/TypeScript
- Additional build complexity compared to vanilla JS
- Need to carefully manage performance with React components around 3D rendering

## Implementation Notes

We will set up the project with:
- Vite for build tooling
- ESLint and Prettier for code quality
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- React 18+ for concurrent rendering features
