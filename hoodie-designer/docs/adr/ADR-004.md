# ADR 0004: Body Tracking Implementation

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AR visualization feature requires body tracking to properly position and scale the 3D hoodie model on the user's body. We need to determine the most effective approach for implementing body tracking given web browser constraints and the need for real-time performance.

## Decision

We will use **TensorFlow.js PoseNet/MoveNet** for body pose estimation, integrated with our WebXR implementation.

## Rationale

- **TensorFlow.js** provides pre-trained models for human pose detection
- Models can run directly in the browser without server-side processing
- PoseNet/MoveNet provide key body points that can be mapped to hoodie positioning
- Performance is suitable for real-time applications on modern hardware
- Well-maintained library with good documentation and community support
- Can work alongside WebXR for a complete AR solution

## Alternatives Considered

1. **MediaPipe**: Google's solution for pose estimation, but with less seamless browser integration than TensorFlow.js.
2. **Custom Computer Vision Approach**: Would require significant expertise and development time.
3. **WebXR Anchors only**: Insufficient for accurate body tracking without additional pose estimation.
4. **Commercial Body Tracking SDKs**: Would introduce licensing costs and potential vendor lock-in.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Real-time body tracking directly in the browser
- No server-side processing required
- Flexible mapping between detected pose and 3D model
- Can run on consumer hardware (MacBooks with camera)

### Negative

- Computational intensity may affect overall application performance
- Accuracy depends on camera quality, lighting conditions, and user positioning
- Initial model loading may introduce latency
- Privacy considerations with camera usage

## Implementation Notes

We will implement the following approach:

1. Load TensorFlow.js and the pose detection model asynchronously
2. Process camera feed frames at a controlled rate (15-30 fps)
3. Extract key body points (shoulders, chest, hips)
4. Map these points to corresponding anchor points on the 3D hoodie model
5. Apply transformations (position, scale, rotation) to align the model with the detected body
6. Implement smoothing to reduce jitter in tracking

## Performance Considerations

- Use lower-resolution model variants for devices with limited processing power
- Implement detection throttling based on device capabilities
- Cache pose results and use interpolation between detections
- Separate detection thread from rendering thread when possible
