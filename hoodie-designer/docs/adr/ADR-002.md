# ADR 0002: 3D Rendering Library Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The 3D Hoodie Designer application requires a robust 3D rendering solution that can handle model loading, manipulation, and integration with AR. We need to select a library that balances performance, feature richness, and ease of integration.

## Decision

We will use **Three.js** as our primary 3D rendering library, with **react-three-fiber** as a React wrapper for better integration with our React-based UI.

## Rationale

- **Three.js** is the most mature and widely-used 3D library for the web
- It has excellent documentation and community support
- Built-in support for GLTF/GLB model loading
- Good WebXR integration for AR capabilities
- Flexible enough to implement custom shaders and effects
- **react-three-fiber** provides a React-friendly API for Three.js
- Performance optimizations like instancing are available when needed

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Babylon.js**: While powerful and well-documented, has less community adoption than Three.js and fewer React integration options.
2. **A-Frame**: More focused on VR than general 3D manipulation, though it has good AR capabilities.
3. **PlayCanvas**: More of a complete engine than a library, would be harder to integrate into our custom application.
4. **WebGL directly**: Would require significantly more low-level code for features that Three.js provides out of the box.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Robust, battle-tested 3D rendering capabilities
- Excellent model loading and manipulation
- Good performance on modern browsers
- Seamless integration with WebXR for AR
- Large community for support and learning resources

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers not familiar with 3D graphics
- Need to carefully manage performance when scenes become complex
- Some advanced features may require custom WebGL shaders

## Implementation Notes

We will use:
- Three.js core for 3D rendering
- GLTFLoader for model loading
- OrbitControls for camera manipulation
- react-three-fiber for React integration
- drei for common Three.js abstractions
