# ADR 0006: Testing Framework Selection

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The 3D Hoodie Designer application requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and quality. As we are following Test-Driven Development (TDD), we need to select appropriate testing frameworks and approaches that can handle the unique challenges of testing 3D and AR web applications.

## Decision

We will use the following testing stack:
- **Jest** as the primary test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Cypress** for end-to-end testing
- Custom test utilities for Three.js and WebXR testing

## Rationale

- **Jest** provides a complete testing solution with mocking capabilities
- **React Testing Library** encourages testing from a user perspective
- **Cypress** offers robust browser-based testing for complete user flows
- This combination gives us coverage across unit, integration, and e2e testing levels
- Good TypeScript support across all selected tools
- Active maintenance and community support

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Mocha + Chai**: More configuration required compared to Jest's all-in-one approach.
2. **Enzyme**: More implementation-focused than React Testing Library, which can lead to brittle tests.
3. **Playwright**: Newer than Cypress with less established patterns for our use case.
4. **WebdriverIO**: More complex setup compared to Cypress for our needs.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Consistent testing approach across all levels
- Strong TypeScript integration
- Good developer experience with fast feedback cycles
- Ability to test both standard React components and 3D/AR features
- Support for TDD workflow

### Negative

- Challenge in testing WebXR features that require hardware
- Need for custom mocks and utilities for Three.js and WebXR
- Potential performance issues when testing complex 3D scenes
- Learning curve for writing effective tests for 3D/AR features

## Implementation Notes

### Unit Testing with Jest

- Test individual functions and components in isolation
- Use mocks for Three.js objects and WebXR APIs
- Focus on business logic and transformations

### Component Testing with React Testing Library

- Test component rendering and user interactions
- Use custom test utilities for Three.js components
- Focus on user-facing behavior, not implementation details

### End-to-End Testing with Cypress

- Test complete user flows
- Mock WebXR for AR testing when needed
- Focus on critical user journeys

### Custom Test Utilities

We will implement custom test utilities for:
- Mocking Three.js objects and scenes
- Simulating WebXR sessions
- Verifying 3D transformations and scene composition
- Providing test fixtures for 3D models and textures

## Mocking Strategy

- Create mock implementations of Three.js classes
- Mock WebXR API and camera inputs
- Use dependency injection to allow substituting real implementations with test doubles
