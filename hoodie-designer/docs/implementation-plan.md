## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| WebXR API changes | High | Medium | Monitor spec changes, implement feature detection |
| TensorFlow.js performance issues | Medium | Medium | Implement fallback modes, optimize detection frequency |
| Browser compatibility gaps | High | High | Feature detection, graceful degradation, clear requirements |
| Complex model handling | Medium | Medium | Model optimization utilities, size/complexity limits |
| Camera permissions denied | High | Low | Clear permission requests, fallback to non-AR mode |

1. Users can upload their own 3D hoodie models or use the built-in wireframe generator
2. Models can be manipulated (rotate, scale, move) with intuitive controls
3. AR visualization works on compatible MacBooks with accurate body tracking
4. The application is performant and responsive across supported browsers
5. All test suites pass with >80% coverage
